&#x20;\- Rate - the amount of currency you will receive after the exchange. If the amount that you want to exchange is less/more than the amount that is available with the partner, then instead of the amount you receive, the minimum/maximum possible amount that is available for the partner for exchange is displayed.

&#x20;\- ETA - the amount of time the swap will take to complete.

\- Partner - service through which funds are exchanged.

&#x20;\- Type - a type of rate:

&#x20;   \- Floating - Due to cryptocurrency market volatility, the exchange rates may change during the exchange. Choosing the floating, or classic, exchange rate, you need to know that the rates may change at any moment, and you might receive more or fewer coins that you had been expecting..

&#x20;   \- Fixed - If you create a fixed rate exchange, the exchange service will freeze the rates for some time to help you to escape the rate fluctuations. You will have from 15 to 120 minutes to deposit your funds depending on the exchange service you chose. You will receive the estimated amount at the end.

&#x20;\- Support Rate - the speed of the partner's response, in case of any problems associated with using the swap through him.
