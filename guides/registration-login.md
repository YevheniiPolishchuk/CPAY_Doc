There are two roles in the system: Individual, Business. They differ in the available functionality in the system.&#x20;

**Individual** is a type of user who operates only with the merchant's wallets, can accept, send payments, add new merchant wallets and create checkouts. This user has only one merchant.

**Business** is a type of user that is business-oriented, for example, in a retail environment. It is possible to create merchants up to 5, set up its commissions, integrate with a third-party system, create client wallets and create checkouts.

Here's the login forms:
