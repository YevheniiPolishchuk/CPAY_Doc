**Choose Merchant currency** - list for selecting currencies supported by the merchant. If the user has chosen to support a currency that was not previously supported, then clicking on the "Submit" button will create a merchant's default wallet for this currency. For example, when creating a wallet, the user did not select support for ETH, while editing he chose, then in this case, the default wallet of the ETH merchant will be created.

In addition, if you select support for a token, then support for the currency of this token is automatically selected. For example, a user wants to select support for the BUSD token, along with this, support for his currency BNB is selected.
