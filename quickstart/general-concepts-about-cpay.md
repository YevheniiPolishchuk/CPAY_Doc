### Why use CPAY?

* Keep Your Funds Secure, receive your payments directly to merchant wallets;
* Don't be Surprised With High Fees;
*   No hidden costs or hard-to-understand fees, in CPAY exists three type of fees:

    \-Miner Fee - network fee, varies depending on the network load and transaction amount. The owner of the merchant can establish who pays Miner Fee for sending funds from the client's wallet to the merchant's wallet: the merchant or the customer. If the customer has chosen, then the balance of the client's wallet when replenishing is displayed with the deduction of Miner Fee. As an example, a user replenishes his wallet with 0.1 ETH, customer pays the Miner Fee and user will see 0.09976 â€‹ETH on the balance. \
    \-Merchant Fee - fee that set by the owner of the merchant, thus earning on replenishment of clients to client wallets. Client wallet balances are updated taking into account the Merchant Fee. As an example, a user replenishes his wallet with 0.1 ETH, the Merchant Fee is set at 10% in the merchant and the user will see 0.09 ETH on the balance. \
    \-System Fee - CPAY commission charged upon withdrawal and when funds from the client's wallet are transferred to the merchant's wallet. System Fee is sent from the merchant's wallet to a special System Fee wallet after a replenishment or withdrawal transaction has been completed. **Only 1%**
