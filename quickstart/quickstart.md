By default, after registration, one merchant is created (for individual accounts there is only one merchant), for business up to 5.

### Making payments

You can receive funds in two ways:

1\)Create a crypto wallet and send it to your client in order for him to replenish it:\
&#x20;\- if this is a merchant's wallet, then the transaction will not be created, only wallet balance will be updated:

&#x20;\- if this is a client's wallet, then first, the client's wallet is replenished, and after that the funds will go to the merchant's wallet:

2\)Create a checkout:\
&#x20;\- donate - checkout without a fixed amount, after creation a link is generated that the user can create for all his clients:
